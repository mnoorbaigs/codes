Write a program to repeatedly check for the largest number until the user enters “done”.

# Initialize a variable to store the largest number
largest = None

# Start an infinite loop
while True:
    # Ask the user for input
    user_input = input("Enter a number or 'done' to finish: ")
    
    # Check if the user wants to exit the loop
    if user_input.lower() == 'done':
        break
    
    try:
        # Attempt to convert the user input to a floating-point number
        number = float(user_input)
    except ValueError:
        # If conversion fails, inform the user and continue to the next iteration
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number or 'done'.")
        continue
    
    # Compare the entered number to the current largest number
    if largest is None or number > largest:
        # Update the largest number if the entered number is larger
        largest = number

# Check if any valid numbers were entered
if largest is not None:
    # Print the largest number
    print("The largest number entered is:", largest)
else:
    # Inform the user if no valid numbers were entered
    print("No valid numbers were entered.")
