Write a Program to Prompt for a Score between 0.0 and 1.0. If the Score is out of range, print an error. If the score is between 0.0 and 1.0, print a grade using the following table

# Prompt the user for input
try:
    score = float(input("Enter a score between 0.0 and 1.0: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Please enter a numerical value between 0.0 and 1.0")
    exit(1)

# Check if the score is within the valid range
if score < 0.0 or score > 1.0:
    print("Error: Score is out of range (0.0 to 1.0)")
else:
    # Assign a grade based on the table
    if score >= 0.9:
        grade = "A"
    elif score >= 0.8:
        grade = "B"
    elif score >= 0.7:
        grade = "C"
    elif score >= 0.6:
        grade = "D"
    else:
        grade = "F"

    # Print the grade
    print("Grade:", grade)
